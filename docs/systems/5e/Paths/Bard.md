# Bardic Music
At will, as a bonus action, you can start playing music. This is treated the same way as any concentration-based spellcasting, and cannot be done simultaneously with any other concentration-based spell or ability, but is otherwise not considered a spell, and does not cost Mana (unless otherwise noted).

## Starting Songs
Every bard knows these.
+ [Inspiring Melody](): At-will, bonus, em10, concentration; allies are inspired. Once per turn, each ally may choose to expend a Hit Die (if available) to gain Inspiration, and thus advantage to one check, save, or attack.
+ [Marching Beat](): At-will, bonus, em10, concentration; allies gain +2 squares of movement and advantage to Initiative checks. (TBD: some minor improvement for overland travel for people who bother with that sort of thing)
+ [Restoring Hymn](): At-will, bonus, em10, concentration; allies gain the ability, on their turn, as a free action, to expend one Hit Die (if available) to heal themselves the normal amount.

## Songs to be learned
You may exchange a learned spell for one of these songs.

+ [Countersong](): At-will, std, burst 10; roll to dispel (or counterspell, if readied) one magical effect that relies upon sound.
+ [Feel the Healing Beat](): At-will, bonus, close burst 10, 1+ Mana; you heal allies within area for 1d8+Cha (+1d8 for each extra Mana spent). Excess healing becomes temporary HP lasting for the encounter.
+ [Reveille](): At-will, 1 Mana, bonus, burst 10; allies who are currently asleep, stunned, or otherwise unable to act are allowed an additional saving throw immediately against the effect. If you are level 5 or higher, you may choose to spend 3 Mana, in which case they gain advantage to the save.
+ [Sound Barrier](): At-will, 1 Mana, bonus, burst 10; allies gain Absorb 5 (all), lasting up to 2 rounds. You may spend more Mana to add 5 points of Absorb per point.
