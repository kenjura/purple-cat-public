** Each round, you may attempt one of the following, allowing the subject a Will save to negate and end: learn the answer to one question with perfect truth (from subject's point of view), plant/modify/delete one memory of subject's, or take over subject's actions for one round. If you attempt none of these, there is no save to end that round. 
** A special use of this spell is to cause the subject to become your proxy for further jumps. You may effectively re-cast this spell, without ending the original, using the subject as the source. You are now in the new subject's mind. If the new subject removes you, through Will saves or other means, you jump back into the previous subject's mind. There is no limit to the number of jumps you may make in this manner; however, if any subject in the chain exits the radius, or becomes immune to mental effects, you snap back to the nearest valid subject in the chain.
