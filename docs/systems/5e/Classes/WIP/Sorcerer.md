Sorcerers are consummate spellcasters, gifted with innate power, unbound by the need to learn magic through tedious research, and brimming with magical potency, outlasting their more erudite counterparts. The cost of this magnificent talent is that they must confront the danger of their power without the aid of the foci and constraints that make magic easy and safe to wield for other casters. Sorcery is dangerous business, and precious few sorcerers last long enough to reach the highest levels of power--but those that do are fearsome indeed.


# Spells

As a sorcerer, you do not have a fixed spell list, nor a fixed list of spells known. 









# Music
At will, as a bonus action, you can start playing music. This is treated the same way as any concentration-based spellcasting, and cannot be done simultaneously with any other concentration-based spell or ability, but is otherwise not considered a spell, and does not cost Mana (unless otherwise noted).

## Starting Songs
Every bard knows these.
+ [Inspiring Melody](): At-will, bonus, em10; allies are inspired. Once per turn, each ally may choose to expend a Hit Die (if available) to gain Inspiration, and thus advantage to one check, save, or attack.
+ [Marching Beat](): At-will, bonus, em10; allies gain +2 squares of movement and advantage to Initiative checks. (TBD: some minor improvement for overland travel for people who bother with that sort of thing)
+ [Restoring Hymn](): At-will, bonus, em10; allies gain the ability, on their turn, as a free action, to expend one Hit Die (if available) to heal themselves the normal amount.

## Songs to be learned
You may exchange a learned spell for one of these songs.

+ [Countersong](): At-will, std, burst 10; roll to dispel (or counterspell, if readied) one magical effect that relies upon sound.
+ [Reveille](): At-will, 1 Mana, bonus, burst 10; allies who are currently asleep, stunned, or otherwise unable to act are allowed an additional saving throw immediately against the effect. If you are level 5 or higher, you may choose to spend 3 Mana, in which case they gain advantage to the save.
+ [Sound Barrier](): At-will, 1 Mana, bonus, burst 10; allies gain Absorb 5 (all), lasting up to 2 rounds. You may spend more Mana to add 5 points of Absorb per point.



# Talents

Paths:
+ Roguelike (expertise, jack of all trades, sneak attack, etc)
+ Lore
+ Song
+ Battle
+ Other



## Song
+ [Feel the Healing Beat](): Your *Restoring Hymn* healing effect allows allies to spend up to 3 Hit Dice at a time, and the effect repeats each round.




# Spell List

School ideas:
+ Beats: pure sonic attacks.
+ Harmony: support your team with healing, buffs, defense, etc.
  + Alternatively, accompaniment.
+ Improvisation: solo focus?
+ Movement: enchantments, messin' with people's minds.
+ Rhythym: ?
