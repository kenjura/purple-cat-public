# Spells

Gain 2 spells known per Warlock level, plus 2 cantrips when you take your first Warlock level. Max rank allowed:
+ Rank 1: levels 1-4
+ Rank 2: levels 5-9
+ Rank 3: levels 10-14
+ Rank 4: levels 15-19
+ Rank 5: levels 20+

Mana cost: 1 per rank


## Infernal

### Rank 0

### Rank 1
+ [Immolate](): At-will, ranged; subject suffers medium fire damage, plus same on turn start for 3 rounds.

## Fey

### Rank 0

### Rank 1

### Rank 2
+ [Wall of Thorns](): At-will, 2 mana, ranged, wall 1/level, concentration; wall of thorns blocks line of sight and effect (but not sound). Can be crossed by defeating your DC with a Strength check, but the attempt inflicts medium piercing damage.
  + Upgrade: on turn start, your wall reaches out with vines to attack targets within 1 square, pulling them into the wall (Str negates) and causing medium piercing damage. Escaping uses the same mechanic as passing through.


## Shadow (Chaos)

### Rank 0

### Rank 1
+ [Needful Thing](): At-will, 1 mana; you produce a single, mundane object that you can comfortably hold in one hand. Focus: an opaque container that you've been holding for a reasonable length of time that could have conceivably held the item. Other requirements: you must be able to describe a narrative justifying your possession of the item.

### Rank 2





# Corruption
Corruption is a mechanic that allows Warlocks to gain power outside of the normal leveling system. A warlock can be corrupted by nature--often by being born to an Outsider's bloodline--or can become corrupt through use of his magic or even a good old-fashioned deal with the devil.

As a rule, Outsiders want to ensure the quality of their investments--they don't just handle unlimited god-like power to some rando. As such, a Warlock can only gain the benefit of Corruption commensurate with their accomplishments (i.e. character level), although, if they really push it, they can still accumulate the negative effects.

You can choose to gain Corruption effects at any time by conducting a ritual, or even as an immediate action (see [[Demonic Ritual TBD: the 24/7 soul-selling hotline]]

## Types of Corruption

### Fiendish Bloodline

* [Demon Skin](): Your skin is an unusual color, such as green or red. At minimal Corruption, it is only a mild shift from normalcy, but by maximum rank, you are unmistakably monstrous. Gain +1 natural armor bonus to AC and resist 5/rank to fire and poison.
* [Devilsight](): Your eyes glow--this is unnoticeable in daylight, but obvious in darkness. It does not negatively affect stealth. You gain darkvision.
* [Horny Devil](): You gain horns. They are obvious unless covered by a helm or hood. As a benefit, you gain a +1/rank racial bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. 
* [Prehensile Tail](): You gain a prehensile tail, about as long as an arm. It may or may not have spikes. You gain +5 to Balance checks, and the tail can be used to grab things. As a benefit, you gain a +1/rank racial bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
* [Claws of the Beast](): You gain claws on your fingers and toes. Your finger-claws may be used as weapons (stats as a dagger), and do not interfere with normal use of your hands, but they are quite obvious. As a benefit, you gain a +1/rank racial bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.


# Paths

## Bladebound
+ Level 2: summon arms
  + summons a weapon, such as pixie's needle, felhunter's fang, etc. You are of course proficient.
  + can also summon armor and shields
  + when you beat a given outsider, you gain their weapon, armor, or shield
+ Level 6: fusion
  + spend mana to infuse weapon or armor with infernal, fey, shadow energy, for various boons
+ Level 10: metamorphosis
  + as fusion, but fuse into your own body
+ Level 14: armiger
  + summon a bunch of weapons all at once
+ Level 18: ???



# Thoughts
+ Might need a better way to balance bindings, summons, etc besides Mana binding. But it's worthy a try at first.
+ S6 Warlock was probably OP, with summons *and* bindings on top of everything.
+ Summons:
  + Normal spells, they cost mana, only one summon at a time, etc
  + Higher-level summons harder to control, might need to burn other spells to help control them (circles, dominance auras, curses, etc)
  + Bladebound path grants bindings, but they require the summon spell (using same action and cost, but different effect)
