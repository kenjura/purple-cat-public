----------------------- | --------------------------- |
Cast spells             | All                         |
Summon permanent minion | All? Or maybe only Summoner |
Summon minions for mana | All                         |
Minion talents          | Summoner                    | 
Sacrifice minion        | Summoner                    | 
Customize eidolon       | Summoner?                   |
Metamorphosis           | Shaman (wtb better name)    | 





# General ideas

+ If need be, the class can be split into Planewalker and Elementalist, or even...
+ Shaman
  + Has the 6 elements (fire, earth, water, air, plants, animals)
  + Paths: shifter, channeler, conduit
+ Planewalker
  + Schools: Infernal, Fey, etc
  + Paths: bladebound, summoner
