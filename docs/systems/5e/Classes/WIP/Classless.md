# Classless

It's not really classless, but it's a fair approximation using three classes: Warrior, Practitioner, and Enhanced.


# Basics

+ Enhanced: 1 per level, no cap, can't repeat adajacent levels

# Warrior Abilities

## Maneuvers

TBD. You know the drill:
+ Cleave
+ Power Attack
+ Battlemaster shit
+ Sneak Attack
+ Ranger/monk/barbarian shit
+ etc...nobody cares


# Enhanced Abilities

## Superpowers

The kind of things that you'd think would be in a monster class, but frankly, these abilites have an insane degree of overlap. In many ways, this is the "monster" class.

Types of superpowers:
+ Basic but useful, e.g.
  + Resist
  + Special attacks
  + Movement types
+ Talent trees, e.g.
  + Lifedrain (vampire)
  + Infernal



# Practitioner

## Spellcasting
+ Spellcraft skill: 1d20 + Int + prof. bonus
  + Used to cast spells, set DCs, counterspell, etc
+ Mana
  + Base amount determined by levels (e.g. 2/lev)
  + When you take a short rest, you can regain 1 Mana per rank. Can use this ability once per Wis bonus per day (can combine multiple into a single short rest, similar to Hit Dice)
+ Damage
  + Light: 1d4/rank + Cha + prof
  + Med: 1d8/rank + Cha + prof
  + High: 1d12/rank + Cha + prof
+ Max spell level
  + As wizard
