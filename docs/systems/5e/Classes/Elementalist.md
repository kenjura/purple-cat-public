Think Druid without all that tree-hugging stuff. I mean, they can do that if they want, but it's not a requirement.

## Spellcasting skill
Choose one of the following skills:
+ [Bond](): A Wisdom-based skill that expresses a harmonious bond you share with the elements, based on mutual respect and a thoughtful regard for the power and responsibility afforded you by the bond.
++ Advantage: you may call upon your Bond to request temporary knowledge of a spell you don't know, but are allowed to cast. This may be done once per long rest per point of Wisdom modifier.
+ [Dominance](): A Charisma-based skill that reflects an approach to magic centered on pure willpower. An elementalist using Dominance contests directly with the elemental forces they command, achieving a great degree of control if successful, but risking lashback when their will falters.
++ Advantage: when you roll a critical success on a Dominance check to cast a spell, you enter a Clearcasting state, wherein the next spell you cast within 1 round costs no base mana. You may also expend a state of Inspiration to gain Clearcasting.
++ Disadvantage: when you roll a critical failure on a Dominance check to cast a spell, you lose control of it in spectacular fashion.

You use this skill to cast spells. This skill sets the DC for your spells, and is used as an attack roll when called for.


## Spell Knowledge
At character creation, select 2 spells from the Elementalist list per level, plus 4 cantrips.

Each level thereafter, add 2 more spells of your choice of any appropriate rank (including cantrips).

# Spell List


## Rituals
You do not need to use your Spells Known on rituals; you may cast any ritual on this list that you are high enough level to case.

### Rank 0
- [Mark of the Wild](): 1 minute cast, touch, attuned; subject gains an elaborate tattoo, indicating that they are aligned with the forces of the wild. Thereafter, natural animals that might be hostile instead treat them with indifference, as long as the animals are not attacked by the subject. Pests avoid subjects and their belongings. Animals inclined to be indifferent become helpful--if ailing, subjects may be aided by wildlife, within their capability. Subjects do not leave tracks in natural terrain while traveling.
  - When cast on yourself, this effect is more powerful. To wit:
    - Fey creatures inclined to prey on or trick you are instead indifferent (if their CR is lower than your level).
    - You gain advantage to saving throws against any effect produced by a natural animal, plant, or Fey creature.
    - You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.
    - You can communicate with animals and plants. This does not confer intelligence on such creatures, nor does it charm or compel the creatures. You may use social skills such as Persuasion, with effects deemed reasonable by the DM, given the capabilities of the creature with which you are dealing.


### Rank 1
- [Endure Elements](): 1 minute cast, touch, can cast on a linked group up to 1 target/level, attuned; subjects gain a magical ward against natural elemental hazards. This is "attuned", meaning it occupies one of subject's magic item attunement slots (if unoccupied), or their concentration slot.
  - Temperature: warded subjects treat extreme weather more mildly. Weather that requires normal cold weather gear requires nothing; that requiring extreme cold weather gear is comfortable with normal cold weather gear. Hot weather at the extreme end of habitability (120F / 50C) is reasonably comfortable.
  - Precipitation: rain slides off subjects as if they were oiled. Clothing does not become damp. Metal armor does not rust. Normal sized hailstones bounce off harmlessly.
  - Wind: normal winds (lower than a tropical storm, about 40 mph / 64 km/h) do not interfere with movement (although they may affect projectiles, held objects such as books, torches, etc). Other wind effects are halved.
  - UV: Normal UV exposure causes no skin damage. UV-sensitive beings such as vampires suffer half normal effect. 

### Rank 2
- [Commune With Nature](): 10 minute cast; you sense the terrain within 1 mile/level horizontally, and 100 ft/level vertically. You sense the layout well enough to accurately map the terrain. You can tell what kinds of soil, plants, and animals are in the area. You sense the shape of artificial construction, but cannot sense its constitution.
- [Control Weather](): 1 minute cast, centered circle 1 mile; changes the weather in the local area to any reasonable possibility for the season. Takes 10 minutes to take effect, and lasts 1 hr/level after you concentrate.
- [Reincarnation](): 1 minute cast, requires a spirit or a intact remains no more than 1 hr/level dead, and a helpless natural creature; sacrificial creature's life ends, and the spirit of the dead is transferred into the body. If the bodies are of different types (e.g. humanoid and animal), subject has disadvantage to all Strength and Dexterity skills, attacks, and saves for 24 hours while familiarizing. The transition is permanent; transferring the spirit to yet a new body would require killing the body and using a similar ritual on a new one. The ritual does not destroy the spirit's old body.

### Rank 3
- [Rebirth](): 1 hour cast, requires 90% of remains; resurrects a subject who has been dead for up to 24 hours. After first 10 minutes of casting, dead subject's body quickly rots and merges with the earth. A sproutling quickly grows, revealing a viney cocoon. After 1 hour, the coccoon cracks open, revealing a fresh, healthy body identical to the subject's original, but during early childhood (approximately halfway to full growth; for humans, about 8 years old). Subject regains use of their body, but suffers disadvantage to Strength and Dexterity checks and attacks while their unwieldly and underdeveloped body grows. Any clothing or armor sized for their adult form does not fit. Each long rest, subject ages up to 10% of their species' max lifespan, to a maximum of their original age at death. No process can interrupt this aging prematurely. After the first long rest, the disadvantage penalty is removed.

### Rank 4
### Rank 5


## General

### Rank 0
+ [Absorb Elements](): You absorb an elemental attack. Can be used in one of three ways:
  + Reaction, triggered when you are about to suffer elemental damage (i.e. fire, frost, lightning). Roll a casting skill check against the incoming spell. On success, you negate its effect (for you) and gain its Mana cost as temporary Mana for Elementalist spells. On failure, you suffer half the damage and gain only half the Mana.
  + As an action, you can touch an ongoing elemental damage spell and attempt to dispel it. Roll opposed casting skill check; on success, it is dispelled and you get the (temp) Mana, on failure, it isn't dispelled.
  + As an action, you can absorb energy from from an environment that is capable of causing elemental damage (e.g. being engulfed in a burning fire, standing in a lightning storm, etc, doesn't include spell effects). You gain 1 point of temporary Mana per Elementalist rank.
  + Can be used to hurt elemental
+ [Affect Elements](): You shape elements in mild ways.
  + Fire: as a standard action, you can shape a natural fire within range, either increasing or decreasing its size by one category. (A fine fire becomes nonexistent when decreased).
  + Air: you can cause minor air currents to blow as a bonus action within range. This could have effects such as blowing a stack of papers off a desk, causing minor concealment in one square by spraying dust or sand, blowing out a candle or torch, etc.
  + Water: as you concentrate, you can cause water to take any shape within a medium size while still attached to its original body, or cause a huge or smaller body of water to lean one way or another. Can be used to boost the speed of a small watercraft by a few miles per hour, or to rock a small craft causing occupants to have to save or fall overboard.
  + Earth: as you concentrate, you can create or destroy footprints or other minor markings in fresh earth within a 15 ft radius. If an area is difficult terrain due to uneven, sticky, or slippery terrain, you can remove the difficulty within this area as you concentrate.
  + Life: as you concentrate, you can cause undergrowth to part in a radius of 15 ft, removing difficult terrain. Does not function on magically-enchanted barriers higher than level 0.

### Ideas
+ Command Elements: take over enemy elemental spells, command elementals, affect nonmagical elemental stuff (e.g. raging fires)

+ [Control Wind](): at-will, std, em5, concentration; you control the winds within the area. Each round, you can choose one effect as a free action:
  + Calm: no wind effects.
  + Gale: a steady wind pushes in a chosen direction. Moving against the wind requires a Strength check (failure: half speed; flying and small creatures disadvantaged). Moving with the wind grants +50% movement speed. Ranged attacks are disadvantaged against the wind, and advantaged with it.
  + Chaos: ranged attacks intersecting area are disadvantaged, flying creatures (medium or smaller) lose half movement speed.
+ [Wind Wall](): at-will, std, ranged, wall 1/level; wall blocks line of effect for projectiles fired from Large or smaller weapons, and blocks flight of Small or smaller creatures. Larger creatures can fly through by passing a Strength check against your DC.

### Rank 2
+ [Lightning Storm](): at-will, std, emanation 10; you call down up to 3 lightning strikes to 3 different targets, each inflicting medium lightning damage. If you concentrate, you can extend the duration, calling down 3 more strikes per round as a standard action, or 1 strike per round as a bonus action, to a maximum duration of 5 rounds.
  + For each +1 Mana spent, you can call down 1 additional lightning strike per standard action. For every 2 Mana, you can call down 1 additional strike per bonus action.
+ [Levitate](): at-will, swift, concentration; you levitate on a column of air, gaining the ability to fly up to your walking speed, with a maximum altitude of 30 ft.
+ [Lightning Shield](): at-will, swift, ranged, 3 charges (max 1/rd); when anyone strikes subject in melee, they suffer heavy lightning damage and must pass a Con save or lose the attack.
+ [Mistform](): at-will, swift, concentration; you become gaseous. You are immune to nonmagical attacks, but cannot take any physical actions (including spellcasting that requires any components). Your movement becomes fly 10-ft.
+ [Thin Air](): ranged, std, concentration, cirlce 4; area is devoid of air.  Air-breathing creatures immediately suffer light internal damage, and must pass a Con save each round to avoid the same. Speech is impossible, including verbal components for spellcasting. Does not distinguish between friend and foe.

### Rank 3
+ [Lightning Step](): at-will, move, 1 mana, ranged; you turn into a bolt of lightning, traveling at the speed of light toward a location you can see, then reappear in a crash of lightning at the destination, causing a burst 2 inflicting light lightning damage. Not considered teleportation; there must be a path that lightning could follow (through air or conductive materials, can snake around as needed).
  + Alternate use: at-will, std, 3 mana; as above, but the maximum distance is 1 mile/level. For each +1 mana, can add 1 willing participant who shares the action and maintains bodily contact.
+ [Thunderlance](): at-will, std, line 1x20 or 2x10; heavy thunder damage plus push to edge of line.
+ [Tranquility](): at-will, std, emanation 10, concentration, max 3 rds; a tranquil sensation fills the air. Allies are healed for light damage on turn start while you concentrate. Additionally, allies may gain the benefit of a short rest as a bonus action while inside the area.
+ [Wall of Lightning](): at-will, std, ranged, wall 1/level; wall of standing lightning bolts shocks anyone who attempts to cross for heavy lightning damage plus stun 1 rd (Con negates). Also blocks line of sight.



### Others
+ Summon Air Elemental
+ Stormlash


## Earth

### Rank 0
+ [Stone Shape](): At-will, variable action, ranged; you reshape a volume of earth within the area (usually the ground, but perhaps the walls or other earth in radius).
  + Fist: std; fist attacks target in melee, inflicting medium bludgeoning damage.
  + Grip: std, concentration; make a grab attack against a walking creature. Thereafter, they are immobilized (Str ends).
  + Barrier: swift, concentration; vertical earthen barrier blocks line of sight and effect in a 5-ft by 5-ft square, 6 inches thick. Barrier has 50 hit points and disappears after you stop concentrating.
  + etc...

### Rank 1
+ [Earthbind](): At-will, std, ranged, concentration; subject's personal gravity increases dramatically. Walking creatures must pass a Strength save to move, and even on success, only move at half speed. Flying creatures plummet, but their flying ability allows them to limit falling speed to avoid falling damage. Still, they cannot fly under this effect. Larger creatures enjoy no protection from this spell, as their superior strength is countered by their increased mass. Creatures who are prone under the effects of this spell cannot rise as a move action; they must use a standard action, and must pass a Strength save to succeed.
+ [Soften Earth](): At-will, swift, ranged, concentration; a single earthen object (or a small chunk of a larger whole) is softened. Effects vary:
  + Metal or stone weapon: disadvantage to hit, shatters on a natural 1.
  + Metal or stone armor: half bonus to AC.
  + Metal or stone creature: half bonus to AC from natural armor.
  + Dirt or soil: circle 5 becomes muddy, difficult terrain
  + Stone surface: 1 cubic inch per level becomes as workable as clay.
+ [Stomp](): At-will, std, cone 3 or burst 1; non-flying subjects are knocked prone (Dex negates), and suffer medium bludgeoning (falling) damage if they fail the save.

### Rank 2
+ [Earth Shield](): At-will, reaction, 2 mana; when you take damage equal to more than 10% of your maximum HP, you can use this reaction to limit the damage suffered to 10% of your maximum HP. You quickly form a skin of solid stone; the attack shatters the stone, which absorbs the energy, and falls as rubble to the ground.
+ [Rusting Grasp](): At-will, std, touch; touched metal object of size medium or smaller, if subject to corrosion (i.e. not gold), is immediately corroded to the point of ruin. If object is magical, it is allowed a saving throw to negate; on failure, it is still ruined, but an enchanter can make use of its remains to create the same enchantment on a fresh, identical item.
  - Alternate use: at-will, std, ranged; same effect, but subject is allowed a Dex save to avoid.

### Rank 3
+ [Control Gravity](): At-will, std, ranged, circle 3 (height 30 ft), concentration; you control gravity in the area. Each round, as a free action, choose one:
  - Crush: When switching to this mode, all creatures and objects suffer the effect of [Earthbind](). Any non-landed creatures and objects first fall to the ground, suffering double the appropriate falling damage.
  - Zero G: Gravity is nullified. Walking creatures quickly lose footing and start to levitate (effectively rooted). Flying creatures can move normally after brief confusion.
  - Reverse: Gravity reverses, causing everything not nailed down to quickly rise to the top of the effect. If no obstructions exist at or below the max height, objects and creatures levitate at the top of the effect. If obstructions exist, they suffer falling damage as appropriate.

## Fire 

### Bindings
+ [Fire Resistance](): Costs 2 mana; you gain Resist (fire).
  + [Fire Immunity](): Costs 4 mana; you gain Immune (fire).

### Rituals
+ [Heat Rock](): Ritual; target rock (or other object that won't be destroyed by intense heat) radiates warmth like a campfire for up to 8 hours. It's probably someone's jam.

### Rank 0 
+ [Wildfire](): At-will, std, ranged, circle 0; area is set alight. On the start of the next turn, subjects inside suffer medium fire damage. Next turn, the fire spreads one square in all directions, and inflicts light damage. After that, if anything within the area is flammable, it becomes a normal fire.

### Rank 1
+ [Flames!](): At-will, std, cone 3; medium fire damage. Or, at-will, std, ranged; heavy fire damage.
+ [Heat Stroke](): At-will, std, ranged; subject suffers heavy poison damage plus *poisoned* for 1 rd. On successful Con save, they suffer half damage and are not *poisoned*.

### Rank 2
+ [Mana Burn](): At-will, std, ranged; targeted spell with an ongoing duration is set ablaze. If the spell is being actively concentrated on, you must defeat the caster in a spellcasting skill check. If the spell's mana cost is equal to or less than Mana Burn, it ends immediately, and anyone within its targeting or area suffers light fire damage. Otherwise, the spell becomes half as effective (half damage, advantage to save), and its effective mana cost is reduced by the cost of Mana Burn. Does not work on fire spells.
+ [Solar Flare](): At-will, std, cone 3; medium fire damage, plus ionizing plasma causes metallic or robotic creatures or vehicles to become incapacitated for 1 rd (Con negates).
+ [Wall of Fire](): At-will, std, ranged, wall 1/level, concentration; wall blocks line of sight, and inflicts heavy fire damage to anyone who crosses it.

### Rank 3
+ [Fusion Beam](): At-will, std, line 1x10; heavy fire damage. Plus, anything slain by the beam becomes the center of a burst 3 inflicting medium fire damage.
+ [Birth of the Phoenix](): Encounter, bonus; you gain a corona of flames. Thereafter, if you should drop to 0 HP before the spell ends (duration is 1 minute), instead of rolling death saves or proceeding as otherwise normal, you immediately explode in a burst 10, inflicting however many HP you had at the time of casting as fire damage to anyone in the radius who harmed you, and healing yourself to the same amount. The spell does not require concentration, but can be dispelled.
+ [Plasma Cutter](): narrow beam so hot it can cut through metal. TBI

### Rank 4
+ Transmute Rock to Lava: turns an area of stone into lava. TBD





### Synergy
+ By spending 1 Mana, your ***Entangling Roots*** becomes a fire effect which causes medium fire damage each round to targes.
  + Also works on ***Briar Patch***, ***Wall of Thorns***, ***Tree Shape*** probably, etc
+ Your Lifebloom causes fire damage to enemies

### Ideas
+ Flame Blossom
+ Radiation
+ Sunlight
+ Fire Form stuff
+ Utility!



## Frost

### Rank 0
+ [Frostform](): Concentration, ranged, 1 action; you create a mundane object out of frost, up to Small size. Roll spellcasting skill to determine how useful it is, if required. To make something larger, add +1 Mana per size above Small.


### Rank 1
+ [Frost Armor](): 1 mana, bonus, attuned; an aura of cold freezes ice that covers your body. You gain your proficiency bonus to AC (not stacking with armor). Anyone who touches you in melee suffers *chilled* for 1 round (Con negates).

  + Alternate: reaction; you encase yourself in a Frost Block, which you can dismiss or wait until it melts.
+ [Wall of Ice](): 2 mana, concentration, ranged, 1 action, wall 1/level; 20-ft high wall of ice blocks line of sight and effect, each 5-ft wide section has (heavy damage) HP and can be broken, but reforms 1 round after breaking.




## Life

### Rank 0
+ [Entangling Roots](): At-will, std, ranged, concentration; subject is immobilized by roots (Str ends). Can widen by 1 square for 1 mana, stackable.
+ [Share Senses](): At-will, std, ranged; you become motionless, and gain the ability to experience the senses of the targeted natural animal, as well as direct their actions. If the animal has a CR equal to yours, they are allowed a Cha save to eject you once per round (max 3 saves). Any time you issue a command that leads them into unreasonable danger, they get an additional save (no limit). Otherwise, lasts as long as you concentrate.

### Rank 1
+ [Fester](): At-will, std, ranged, 3 rds, subject must be missing Hit Points due to slashing or piercing damage, or otherwise an effect leaving open wounds; subject's wounds begin to fester with infectious bacteria, leaking noisome odors that attract nearby insects. Subject suffers light poison damage on turn start as long as the original wound remains open. Magical healing equal to the amount that caused the wound will close it, as will an equal amount of fire damage applied specifically to the wound. The magical effect ends after 3 rounds, although the physical and biological effects remain.
+ [Primal Rage](): At-will, std, ranged; subject flies into a rage, gaining the benefits of a barbarian's Rage ability, but losing the ability to use human intelligence (speech, higher reasoning, spellcasting), instead acting as a fairly intelligent animal in anger (e.g. wolf, lion, elephant). Subject retains knowledge of who is friend and foe. Unwilling subjects can attempt to end the effect (Wis ends). Each round the rage lasts beyond 5, subject must pass a Con save or gain 1 level of exhaustion. If they reach 5, the rage ends automatically.
+ [Roar](): At-will, std, close burst 10; you let out a terrifying primal roar, more befitting a massive predator than a humanoid. Enemies are *frightened* if they fail a Wisdom saving throw. Natural animals are instead *panicked*, immediately fleeing until they near exhaustion. Intelligent enemies (e.g. humans) who see you emanate the sound gain advantage to the saving throw, realizing you are not some unseen, massive beast, but are still something to be reckoned with.
+ [Thorns](): At-will, swift, 5 rds; targeted wood or plant matter sprouts thorns. Effect varies:
  + Self: you inflict light piercing damage on all melee attackers (or medium for grab attacks).
  + Entangling Roots: inflict light piercing damage each round.
  + Staff or wooden weapon: increase damage die, add piercing damage.
  + etc

### Rank 2
+ [Bloodlust](): At-will, swift, ranged, variable duration; subject gains a furious lust for blood, gaining an additional damage die with all damaging attacks, as well as an additional action each round (can only be an attack, a bonus-action spell that inflicts harm, or a move that facilitates attacking). Each round, subject must pass a Con save, DC 10 + number of rounds in bloodlust; on failure, the effect ends, and they become fatigued for an equal number of rounds (half movement, disadvantage to hit/damage).
* [Briar Patch](): At-will, std, ranged, circle 5, 1 minute; area becomes difficult terrain for enemies. Additionally, enemies who enter area or start a turn in area must pass a Strength save or be immobilized. For each save attempted, they suffer light piercing damage.
* [Deathblossom](): At-will, std, ranged; subject begins to acquire a pallid complexion, and tiny sprouts puncture its skin from within, blossoming into beautiful, exotic flowers. Subject gains the disease *Deathblossom*, which causes light necrotic damage on turn start. Each time this disease inflicts damage, allies within 2 squares are healed for the same amount (splitting it evenly if multiple allies need healing). The disease can be removed with any magic that removes diseases, or by dispelling the spell, or by applying magical healing of any amount greater than the most recent amount of necrotic damage suffered. Otherwise, it persists. If subject dies with the disease, their body rapidly decays over one minute, creating a massive bloom of beautiful, deadly flowers.


Ideas:
+ Regrowth
+ Tree Shape
+ Wall of Thorns
+ [Purge](): at-will, swift, ranged; dispels a beneficial spell or ongoing effect, Con negates. Or, dispels a harmful spell or ongoing effect, Con avoid nauseated 1 rd.


### Rank 3
+ Antilife Shell
+ Awaken

### Synergy
+ Wild Growth (Metamagic): for 1 Mana, you can modify any Fire spell such that they do not harm your allies, nor do they burn innocent creatures (including plants, etc) but rather cause the blossoming of life. Against non-enemies with Hit Points, the spells heal for half the damage they would have done.

### Ideas
+ Warp Wood
+ Rot From Within
+ Reincarnate


## Spirit

### Rank 0
+ [Hex](): At-will, std, ranged, 1 minute; subject suffers ill fortune. Each time they roll an attack, skill check, or saving throw, they must subtract 1d4 from the result.
  - Can be extended to 1 hour for 1 Mana.

### Rank 1
+ [Spirit Animal](): swift, 1 Mana, concentration; you conjure a spiritual entity in the shape of a lesser animal, such as an owl, weasel, or crab (i.e. CR 0). It is incorporeal and cannot attack material targets, but it can move as you direct, and you can share its senses and feelings while you concentrate (although you are unaware of your own while you do so). It can phase through barriers, but cannot enter magical thresholds.

### Rank 2
+ [Spirit of Vengeance](): std, 2 Mana, concentration; you conjure one or more spiritual entities who fight as you direct for a time. Choose any nonmagical beast of CR 1/2, or two of CR 1/4; the creature has the same abilities, but is also incorporeal (its natural weapons strike as necrotic damage, and it can phase through creatures and barriers as difficult terrain, but can't end turns there).
  - Alternate use: when cast on an ally who is at 0 HP or dead, animates their spirit as an incorporeal entity under their control. They have the same physical and magical abilities they had in life (although they are incorporeal, so they cannot make physical contact with nonmagical weapons, but they can use a necrotic touch inflicting medium damage). Lasts up to 1 minute/level as long as they remain below 1 HP. If their body dies (or is already dead), you can extend their spiritual form indefinitely by reserving 2 Mana. If you should perish while sustaining them, they move on to a new form per DM discretion (e.g. ghost, lost soul, totem spirit, or just move on to the afterlife).
+ [Spirit Walker](): 1 minute, concentration; you and up to 1/level willing participants leave your bodies behind and take on spiritual form. Thereafter, you may travel as incorporeal spirits (fly speed = walking speed, can't contact nonmagical physical objects, can phase through barriers up to 5 ft thick). Spirits have 25% as many HP as their physical counterparts; if destroyed, the creature returns to their body, having suffered 1d3+1 Wisdom damage. Magic that captures souls can capture such a spirit, preventing its return to the body.


### Ideas
+ Astral Recall
+ Ancestral Spirit - summon incorporeal undead humanoid with useful abilities
+ Cleanse Spirit
+ Purge
+ Ancestral Vision - divination spell based on the knowledge of your ancestors, or those spirits who dwell in the vicinity
+ Spirit Link Totem
+ Ancestral Guidance
+ Hex


## Water

### Ritual
+ Water Breathing: long cast, focus cost; you create a Totem of Water Breathing, which, when worn, imbues wearer with the ability to breathe underwater.
+ Water Walking: long cast, focus cost; you create a Totem of Water Walking, which, when worn, imbues wearer with the ability to walk on the surface of water as if it were solid earth.

### Cantrips
+ [Control Water](): std, 0 Mana, ranged, concentration; you sieze control of an amount of water up to 25 cubic feet per level. It moves as you direct, flowing up to 15 feet laterally per round, and standing up to three times as tall as its base, but otherwise taking shape as you direct. Individual parts of the water can defy gravity, as long as they are connected to the whole, but the mass itself must rest on ground that can support its weight. Any portion of the water separated from the main mass collapses, no longer under your control. 
  + Although you control the shape of the water, you cannot create any internal flux or force--meaning that, for example, a creature inside the water is able to move through it as well as they normally would, without the water itself somehow forcing them to remain inside. A creature might be thwarted in escaping horizontally, as you move the water to continually trap them, but you couldn't stop them from swimming upward and breaking the surface.
+ [Obscuring Mist](): ranged, concentration, circle 2; mist obscures vision in the area. Can move cloud up to your movement rate each turn. To add +1 radius, add +1 Mana.

### Rank 1
+ [Dessicate](): 1 Mana, ranged; subject suffers heavy necrotic damage (Con half). Water elementals, plants, and other creatures made overwhelmingly of water suffer disadvantage. At your option, the extracted water is under your command as in [Control Water]() (approximately a small object if cast on an average medium creature).
+ [Storm Surge](): std, 1 Mana, cone 3; you conjure water, which surges across the ground in front of you, picking up any medium or smaller creatures and pushing them to the edge. In the process, targets suffer light bludgeoning damage. Conjures about 100 cubic feet of water (approx 750 gallons) which does not disappear, but rather flows where it will.
+ [Wall of Water](): swift, 1 Mana, concentration, ranged, wall 4; wall of water 10 feet high and 1 foot thick blocks line of effect, but not movement (although crossing it costs 3 squares of movement instead of 1). Wall does not block line of sight, but does grant concealment.
+ [Binding Mist](): upgrades Obscuring Mist. The mist is thick and difficult to walk through. All creatures suffer 50% movement penalty in the area, and cannot use the Run or Charge actions.

### Rank 2
+ [Drown](): std, 2 Mana, ranged, concentration; you conjure water directly into the target's lungs, causing them to begin drowning. While you concentrate, you are forcing the water to remain there. While drowning, the creature suffers disadvantage to any attack or check unrelated to expelling the water from their lungs. The creature may attempt a Con save each round to expel the water (vs your DC). On success, they are able to breathe, but as long as you concentrate, you retain control of the water and can force it back inside on your next turn.
+ [Cloying Mist](): Upgrades Obscuring Mist. The mist is difficult to breathe. Air-breathing creatures cough and sputter, suffering disadvantage to all checks while inside the area. Should they remain for longer than 5 rounds, they begin to asphyxiate; they must reach clear air within 5 minutes or they will die.

### Rank 3


### Rank 4
+ [Bottomless Depths](): std, 4 Mana, ranged; you open a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. Target must pass a Dex save or be sucked in, whereupon they will find themselves amid infinite water, with no air to be found. The portal closes immediately and permanently thereafter.

### Elemental Alignment

Once per round, as a free action, you can choose one Elementalist school to align with. This manifests in a tangible way--for instance, aligning with Air may cause winds to whip around, sparks of lightning to form from your fingertips, etc. Choosing a new element cancels the effect from any previous element.

The effect of this is that you gain Resistance to an appropriate damage type (see below), and enhancements to spellcasting within that school, namely:
+ You can maintain 2 concentration effects of that school at a time, instead of 1 (you still have to cast them separately)
+ Your cantrips within that school are enhanced in one of the following ways (chosen at spellcasting time):
  + Increase damage (light->med, med->heavy)
  + Advantage to hit (or setting DC)
  + Disadvantage to enemy saves
  + Enlarge or Extend

### Unleash the Elements

Swift, 2 Mana, ranged; you open a portal to a chosen elemental plane in the designated space. This causes a number of effects:
+ Constant effect, depending on element:
  + Air: powerful winds blast outward from the portal, equivalent to a Gale from [Control Wind](). Each creature within 2 squares of the portal must pass a Dex save each round or be zapped for medium lightning damage.
  + Earth: tbd
  + Fire: flames erupt from the portal, causing medium fire damage to anyone adjacent, and light fire damage one square beyond. Anything flammable in the radius catches fire.
  + Water: pure water flows out of the portal at a rate of 100 cubic feet per round, dropping to the ground and flowing radially outward from where it lands. Anyone directly underneath suffers medium bludgeoning damage each round they remain there; they are also grappled by the effect. Anyone in an adjacent square is pushed 2 squares away per round. The water continues to flow as it naturally would--it does not disappear, even when the portal is closed.
+ Each round, if you are within 5 squares of the portal, you gain 1 temporary Mana to be spent on an elemental spell of the same type. The points accrue, but decay at a rate of 1 per round after the portal closes.
+ Each round, there is a cumulative 1% chance that an angry elemental (of appropriate type) will emerge from the portal. This elemental is not under your control, and is angry at having been summoned (although it may not be intelligent enough to know which mortal fleshbag is responsible).

Closing the portal requires you to spend 1 action and pass a Charisma save against your own spell. If you fail, it remains open, although you may retry. You must be conscious to attempt this. 

The portal can be contained or closed by other practitioners using magic that normal affects portals, extraplanar travel, etc.




## Totem Warrior

18    | tbd                                 |

### Totemic Weapon

You may bind a totemic spirit to your weapon or shield. It is a free action to bind a spirit into one or both held weapons and shields, replacing any currently bound spirits. You are proficient with any totemic weapon or shield.

#### Weapon Effects
+ [Firebrand](): You bind a spirit of Flame to your weapon. The weapon emanates heat, and flames lick along its edge. Gain your proficiency bonus as bonus fire damage to each attack, plus same ongoing for 3 rounds.
+ [Frostbrand](): You bind a spirit of Frost to your weapon. The weapon is colder than the heart of a glacier, and is sheathed in fog and frost. Each attack gains your proficiency bonus as bonus frost damage, plus imposes a -1 to target's movement for 2 rounds (stacks and refreshes).
+ [Earthen Brand](): You bind a spirit of Earth to your weapon. The weapon is exceptionally weighty, and its edge becomes far harder than mere steel. Each attack gains your proficiency bonus to damage, and ignores the same amount of AC bonus from armor or natural armor.
+ [Storm Brand](): You bind a spirit of Air to your weapon. It crackles with electricity and hums with galvanic potential. Each attack gains your proficiency bonus as bonus lightning damage, and gains the *ranged* descriptor if it didn't already have it (if it did, TBD)

#### Shield Effects
+ [Earthen Shield](): Gain DR equal to your proficiency bonus. Once per round, when you avoid damage with your shield, you heal yourself or an ally within 5 squares for light damage.
+ [Shield of Air](): Gain your shield bonus to any Dex saves. Once per round, when you avoid damage with your shielld, you can instantly move up to half your movement speed.
+ rest tbd


### Shock
earth shock, frost shock, etc


### Greater Totemic Weapon

Ideas:
+ Frost Brand: freeze enemies solid
+ Storm Brand: weapons can hit in a chain (like Thor's hammer)



## Flameborn
You can become a fire elemental.

Level | Abilities                           |
----- | ----------------------------------- |
2     | Flame On!                           |

10    | Better Flame On?                    |
14    |                                     |
18    |                                     |

### Flame On!
At will, as a free action, you are engulfed in flames that do not harm you. In this state, you gain substantial benefits:
+ Immune to fire damage
+ Anyone who touches you or strikes you in melee combat suffers medium retributive fire damage each time
+ Your weapon attacks and fire spells gain bonus fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
+ Each round, you gain 1 free point of Mana for the purposes of metamagic (widen, chain, enlarge, etc) when casting a fire spell.

However, you must spend 1 point of Mana per round to sustain this effect.


### Elemental Discorporation
You may discorporate your body into a pure elemental form, becoming indistinguishable from that element. This can be used in two ways:
+ You can merge with an existing volume of your element. You may stay in this state as long as you concentrate; it doesn't cost Mana, but you also lose the ability to take any actions other than movement (through the same element) or perception.
+ As a bonus action, you can turn your body into a volume of your element, becoming incorporeal. This costs 1 Mana to initiate, and requires concentration to sustain. You may still move and perceive, but can take no other action. You need not remain within an existing volume of your element. Furthermore, any intersecting objects or creatures are affected by you:
  + Fire: medium fire damage, duh.
  + Water: ?


### Better Flame On! (ugh)

You may upgrade your elemental form as follows, but it costs 2 Mana per round.
+ Flight speed equal to walking speed
+ 2 free points of Mana per round for metamagic (instead of 1)
+ An additional action per turn (i.e. Haste)
