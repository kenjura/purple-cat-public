Sorcerers are consummate spellcasters, gifted with innate power, unbound by the need to learn magic through tedious research, and brimming with magical potency, outlasting their more erudite counterparts. The cost of this magnificent talent is that they must confront the danger of their power without the aid of the foci and constraints that make magic easy and safe to wield for other casters. Sorcery is dangerous business, and precious few sorcerers last long enough to reach the highest levels of power--but those that do are fearsome indeed.


# Spellcasting

{|
!Spell List ||Unrestricted
|-
!Spells known ||No spells per se; you know one [Spell Sphere](#Spell%20Spheres), more with talents
|-
!Spells/day ||Uses [[Mana]]
|-
!Cantrips known ||3 (more with spell mastery)
|}

Sorcerers do not have spellbooks, nor do they gain access to spells by domain or through harmony with the land. Instead, they can cast any spell they desire within their [Spell Spheres](#Spell%20Spheres)...at their own risk.

You gain one [Spell Sphere](#Spell%20Spheres) at level 1. Within that sphere, you may cast any spell, but depending on the result of your Spellcraft skill check, you might fail:
{|
!Spell Level ||1 ||2 ||3 ||4 ||5 ||6 ||7 ||8 ||9
|-
!Spellcraft DC  ||11 ||13 ||15 ||17 ||19 ||21 ||23 ||25 ||27
|}

Failure indicates a ''miscast'', which can have undesirable effects.

It is possible to "master" a given spell, so that you need no longer fear casting failure (except on critical failure). This happens automatically whenever you roll a natural 20 when casting a spell that costs Mana in a situation where you could not take 10 or 20 on the check. (Note: a natural 20 must appear in the first set of dice you roll; subsequent Focus dice that result in 20 are not "natural" 20s).

Miscasting does not occur with cantrips.


## Wild Magic

You may attempt to create magical effects other than those listed in your [Spell Sphere](#Spell%20Spheres). To do this, you must pass either an Int, Wis, or Cha check (non-proficient), depending on how exactly you're flexing your abilities: 
+ Outside the capability of your existing spells: Int check
+ More damage or higher DC: Cha check
+ Larger, longer-lasting, wider area, or just plain "higher Mana cost": Wis check

The DC is based on the effective level of the spell, natch. Failure results in a miscast.


## Miscasting
When you fail the required DC of a spell, roll 2d6:
{|
!Roll !!Result
|-
|2  ||Catastrophic failure. The spell transforms into any other spell you are capable of casting, at the DM's whim, and affects you and your allies, instead of your enemies. Additionally, you lose twice the Mana cost.
|-
|3  ||Spell reversal. The spell succeeds, but swaps enemies and allies. The DM either changes the targeting or just inverts the effect.
|-
|4  ||Spell fizzles, but costs 150% mana.
|-
|5  ||Spell mis-targets; use grenadelike weapon chart.
|-
|6-8  ||Spell fails with no mechanical effect. 100% mana cost.
|-
|9  ||Spell is overpowered. Double effect and mana cost.
|-
|10  ||Spell works normally, but next round, you are force to re-cast it at full cost (with a new failure chance). If you fail to do so, you explode in a close burst 3, losing the full mana cost, inflicting 1d10+Cha force damage per Mana expended.
|-
|11  ||Spell transforms into another spell you are capable of casting, at DM's discretion, with same targeting and Mana cost.
|-
|12  ||'''Wild Surge'''
|}



# Talents
Every even level, you gain a talent, reflecting your innate magical power, independent from the spells in your spheres, but possibly informed by them. Talents tend to be either always-on or otherwise different from spells you could already learn and cast.

## General
+ Extra Sphere: gain an additional spell sphere known. Can take once per 4 sorcerer levels.

## Metamagic

## Faery



# Spell Spheres
