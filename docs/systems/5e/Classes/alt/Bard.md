# Spells

Spell List   | [See Below](#Spell%20List)
Spells Known | 3 + 1/level plus 2 cantrips
Mana         | 2 per level


## Harmony
Harmony is your skill for spellcasting, blah blah blah...






# Music
At will, as a bonus action, you can start playing music. This is treated the same way as any concentration-based spellcasting, and cannot be done simultaneously with any other concentration-based spell or ability, but is otherwise not considered a spell, and does not cost Mana (unless otherwise noted).

## Starting Songs
Every bard knows these.
+ [Inspiring Melody](): At-will, bonus, em10; allies are inspired. Once per turn, each ally may choose to expend a Hit Die (if available) to gain Inspiration, and thus advantage to one check, save, or attack.
+ [Marching Beat](): At-will, bonus, em10; allies gain +2 squares of movement and advantage to Initiative checks. (TBD: some minor improvement for overland travel for people who bother with that sort of thing)
+ [Restoring Hymn](): At-will, bonus, em10; allies gain the ability, on their turn, as a free action, to expend one Hit Die (if available) to heal themselves the normal amount.

## Songs to be learned
You may exchange a learned spell for one of these songs.

+ [Countersong](): At-will, std, burst 10; roll to dispel (or counterspell, if readied) one magical effect that relies upon sound.
+ [Reveille](): At-will, 1 Mana, bonus, burst 10; allies who are currently asleep, stunned, or otherwise unable to act are allowed an additional saving throw immediately against the effect. If you are level 5 or higher, you may choose to spend 3 Mana, in which case they gain advantage to the save.
+ [Sound Barrier](): At-will, 1 Mana, bonus, burst 10; allies gain Absorb 5 (all), lasting up to 2 rounds. You may spend more Mana to add 5 points of Absorb per point.



# Talents

Paths:
+ Roguelike (expertise, jack of all trades, sneak attack, etc)
+ Lore
+ Song
+ Battle
+ Other



## Song
+ [Feel the Healing Beat](): Your *Restoring Hymn* healing effect allows allies to spend up to 3 Hit Dice at a time, and the effect repeats each round.




# Spell List

School ideas:
+ Beats: pure sonic attacks.
+ Harmony: support your team with healing, buffs, defense, etc.
  + Alternatively, accompaniment.
+ Improvisation: solo focus?
+ Movement: enchantments, messin' with people's minds.
+ Rhythym: ?
