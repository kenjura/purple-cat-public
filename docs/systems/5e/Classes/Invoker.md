# Invoker

Commonly--and quite inaccurately--named "warlocks", Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.

A common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.

Of course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.

Special spell types:
+ **Rituals:** rituals do not cost Mana (unless noted) and you automatically know all rituals of the correct level.
+ **Bindings:** bindings are learned like spells, but that's where the similarity ends. Bindings permanently reduce your total Mana, but grant permanent supernatural abilities or traits.


# Taint
By accepting certain permanent disadvantages, you gain bonus bindings. TBD

Notes on summoning:
- You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with "summon" in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.
- Invokers who use Dominance can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Dominance opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.
- Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.
- Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.

### Fusion

You can infuse an amount of planar energy into any weapon you wield or armor you wear as a bonus action. When the weapon leaves your hand, it loses the infusion.

+ Each weapon may be invoked for one action or reaction per turn
+ Reactive defense: as a reaction, one weapon intervenes to defend you or an ally within 30-ft, forcing a contested melee roll between you and the attacker. If the attacker fails, their attack is deflected.
