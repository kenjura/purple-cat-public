# Felicity
The more you learn of witchcraft, the closer you near to true harmony with magic.

Each time you gain this ability, select one permanent benefit from the list below. You immediately gain all benefits appropriate for your current level, and when you gain more levels, you automatically gain the listed benefits for those traits you've selected.

+ [Clarity](): You perceive the flow of magic ever more clearly.
  + Level 5+: You may activate or deactivate Clarity as a free action. It grants the benefits of [http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/detectMagic.htm Detect Magic] and [http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/seeInvisibility.htm See Invisibility] at no Vitae cost.
  + Level 9+: When Clarity is active, you can see the true form of any creature whose form is obscured by illusion, transmutation, or magic of any kind, and your vision penetrates concealement (magical or otherwise) at up to 120 ft.
  + Level 13+: When Clarity is active, you can detect alignment at will, you understand the purpose of spells of any level, and you know exactly what spells a creature in your sight is capable of casting.
  + Level 17+: When Clarity is active, you learn the keywords and weaknesses of magic spells that you see, and your vision penetrates cover (magical or otherwise) within 120 ft.

+ [Rapture](): Using magic soothes and empowers you.
  + Level 5+: Whenever you expend Vitae, you are healed for 1 HP per point spent, and all pain is dampened for several minutes (for magical pain effects, you gain an immediate save to end).
  + Level 9+: Whenever you expend Vitae, you gain advantage to your next saving throw, attack, or skill check, within 1 rd per Vitae spent.
  + Level 13+: tbd

+ [Sympathy](): You are one with magic; spells have a difficult time hurting you.
  + Level 5+: You gain advantage to any save against magic. Additionally, any spell that can discriminate between "friend" and "foe" has a 5% chance per your Witch level to consider you a "friend" regardless of the caster's intentions.
  + Level 9+: Whenever an enemy gain a beneficial or healing effect from a targeted spell within 30 ft, you have a 5% chance per Witch level to gain the same effect. Additionally, whenever you are harmed by a spell (other than a cantrip), you gain 1 Vitae.
  + Level 13+: You gain resistance to all damage caused by magic.
  + Level 17+: Your 5%/level chances are locked to 100%. You may treat any unattended magical effect as if you were the caster (dismissing it, changing it, etc), and if it is attended, you need merely beat the caster in a Charisma check to take control of it.

+ [Defying Gravity](): Everyone finds magic to be uplifting. You take it a bit more literally.
  + Level 5+: You no longer leave tracks when you walk. You find it easier to balance on uncertain terrain, gaining advantage to such checks. You are resistant to falling damage.
  + Level 9+: Your feet don't quite touch the ground. You always have traction as if standing on dry, solid ground, and are never slowed by the likes of snow, mud, or similar terrain. You can fall any distance without suffering any falling damage. When falling, you can glide up to 10 ft horizontally in any direction you choose for each 5 ft you fall.
  + Level 13+: You can fly at the same speed as your walking speed. With the aid of a magic broom, you can double your flying speed (5x for overland flight).
  + Level 17+: ?

#### Summoning
+ [Reanimate](): 1 action, 60-ft, V/S, 5 rounds####  you animate one or more recently-dead (within the last hour) corpses (of humanoids or animals). The cost is one charge of ''Vitae'' per creature animated. You may control a maximum of 1 + 1 per 2 levels as a bonus action (60-ft range, language-dependent); any others act on your last command, or, lacking such command, act as crazed, starved, wild animals might.

  - Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer disadvantage to checks with that score while you possess the shard, and, you gain advantage in turn. Lasts up to 24 hours.
