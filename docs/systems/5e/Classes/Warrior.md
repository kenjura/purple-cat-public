# Warrior
Fighters. They fight.


# Basic Abilities

+ 2 maneuvers/level



# Manuevers

Organized into "schools" for convenience. Comes in three types:
+ Maneuver: something you can do (an action)
+ Upgrade: modifies a maneuver you already have
+ Mastery: a passive bonus

Each ability costs the same currency.



## Defense



## Mobility
+ [Dodge](): Reaction to an incoming targeted attack; roll a Dex save. If it beats the attack, you avoid it entirely.
+ [Evasion](): You can [[Dodge]] area effects;Instead of rolling against the DC set by the enemy, roll a DC of 10 + 5 per square of movement required to exit the area completely. On success, you leap to the nearest safe square. On failure, you leap as far as the dice indicate and fall prone.
+ [Tumble]():  You gain the "jump" movement type. At-will, as a move action, you leap from your current square to a square within half your normal movement rate; you do not step on the ground in any intervening square, but rather follow a shallow parabolic trajectory (max height = 1/4 jump length). You do not provoke for any square of this movement, nor do creatures and objects block your path (although walls do, and, at the DM's discretion, certain creatures may be especially hard to bypass, requiring a Dex check).
+ [Spring Attack](): At-will, std; you move up to half your movement, then attack, then move up to half your movement again. None of the movement provokes from your attack target. Does use up your movement for the round.

#### Mastery
+ [Aerial Attack](): When attacking from at least 10 feet above your opponent using a melee weapon, you inflict critical damage. 
+ [Fleet of Foot](): You gain +10 movement.
+ [Catfall](): You take half damage from falling, and no damage from falling less than 20 feet.

#### Upgrades
+ [Uncanny Dodge](): You do not require awareness or alertness to [[Dodge]] enemy attacks.
+ [Disengage](): When you successfully [[Dodge]] an attack, you can move up to half your base movement (without provoking opportunity attacks).



## Offense



## Trickster

### Rank 1
+ [Sneak Attack](): At-will, std, subject must be unaware of you; as normal weapon attack, but you inflict critical damage. Requires Dex-based melee weapon or ranged weapon within 30 ft.
+ [Kick](): Reaction, triggered by a spell being cast in your threatened area; roll a Dex-based unarmed attack (by default, inflicts 1 + Str bludgeoning damage). Subject must pass a Con save against your DC, or their spell is interrupted and lost.
+ [Blind](): At-will, swift, 10-ft range; you throw sand or grit into subject's eyes, blinding them (Con ends). Must hit with ranged attack. Subject must have eyes.

#### Upgrades
+ [Sap](): When you [[Sneak Attack]] a foe, you can inflict stunned (Con ends) instead of damage using a Dex-based bludgeoning attack.
+ [Blitz](): You can use [[Sneak Attack]] against anyone who hasn't yet acted in the current encounter. (If they happen to act at the same time as you, roll opposed Initiative checks; if you win, you act first.)
