# Thaumaturgy

Thaumaturgy is a skill granted only by certain classes (such as [Witch](/5e/Classes/Witch)). It is used to cast spells of Thaumaturgical nature, which I'm not going to explain right now because you either know what I'm talking about or you don't.

Primary skill uses:
+ Roll to target a targeted spell
+ Roll to set DC of a spell with saves
+ Roll to counter or dispel
+ Etc




# Powers

You may use Thaumaturgy for the following purposes. These are spell-like magical effects, but are not "spells" that you have to learn, spend Mana on (except where noted), etc.

+ [Sense Magic](): You sense magical auras, which can be distinguished by their karmic intent: essentially, you can tell the emotional intent behind the spell (e.g. harmful, helpful, desperate, faithful, etc)
