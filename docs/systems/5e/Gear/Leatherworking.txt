!Item  !!Level  !!Cost  !!Description  !!Effect
|-
|Chimeric Armor  ||2 (major)  ||4,000 GP  ||Made from the hide of the chimera, this primal armor would suit a warrior at home in nature.  ||Grants DR 10 (fire, lightning, acid).
|-
|Wyvern Armor  ||3 (major)  ||6,000 GP  ||This drake-scale armor is lightweight, flexible, and seemingly hard as steel.  ||Grants hardness 5 and resistance to poison.
|-
|Rust Monster Armor  ||5 (major)  ||10,000 GP  ||The hide of a Rust Monster makes for a strange, but effective defense against iron weapons.  ||When you are struck by an iron weapon, it must pass a Constitution save, DC 15, or be rusted (inflicts half damage, including to the attack that just hit you). A rusted weapon that hits you again and fails another save is destroyed. Magic weapons resist this damage.
|-
|Were-fur Armor  ||7 (major)  ||14,000 GP  ||The hide of a lycanthrope has interesting magical properties.  ||Gain Fast Healing 10% while worn. Also, as a bonus action, you may cause the armor to merge into your unarmored form, or call forth your armor from said merge, fully donned.
|-
|Mail of the Hydra  ||10 (major)  ||20,000 GP  ||This scale mail is formed of hydra scales, and its mantle includes two heads, one on each shoulder. On command, they join you in speech, repeating everything you say, allowing you to cast multiple spells at the same time.  ||Once per encounter, you may cast three of the same spell simultaneously, at the cost of three spell slots.  Additionally, you regrow any limbs or heads severed while wearing the armor in 3 rounds, assuming you are alive during the regeneration process. You may not act if you have no head(s).
|-
|Gorgon Mail  ||12 (major)  ||24,000 GP  ||This mail is made from the scales of a gorgon. Those beholding it are slowly turned to stone.  ||On turn start, enemies within 5 squares must pass a Constitution save, DC 16, or be petrified (Con ends, DC 16). They may choose to avert their eyes, and thus are in no risk of petrifying, but any attacks they make against you are treated as if you were invisible.
Additionally, you are immune to petrification.
|-
|Gargoyle Hide  ||15 (major)  ||30,000 GP  ||The hide of a gargoyle can turn between pliable skin and hard stone at your command.  ||Whenever you are struck for damage, you may choose to suffer 10% of your max HP instead. Also, you may turn into a statue or resume your normal form as a free action. (As a statue, you have hardness 20, but you cannot take physical actions)
