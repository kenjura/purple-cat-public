# Freeform Magic

Those who use a casting skill to cast (such as [Dominance](), [Faith](), [Sympathy](), etc) have the option of attempting a spell whose exact effects differ from any known and prepared spell they have available. Here is how it works:

- The caster must be using a casting skill
- The caster must be using [/5e/House Rules/Mana.md](Mana)
- The [/5e/House Rules/Mixed Success.md](Mixed Success) rules must be active
- The desired effect must be in line with the power level of similar known and prepared spells. For example:
  - A wizard who can cast *Fireball* and *Lightning Bolt* could attempt to cast a fire spell that does fireball damage in a line.
  - A sorcerer who only has Force-themed spells cannot use this ability to create lightning.
  - A warlock of 5th level, regardless of known spells, cannot use this ability to replicate a 9th-level spell.
- The mana cost of the desired effect must be in line with said effect.
  - For example, a caster seeking to combine elements of *Fireball* and *Magic Missile* could make a seeking projectile that inflicts fire damage. If the damage is consistent with *Magic Missile* at 1 Mana, the desired effect would cost 1 Mana. If the damage is higher--as in *Fireball*--the mana cost should be 3.
- Casting the spell requires a skill check in order to succeed.
  - DC = 15 + Mana Cost
  - Perfect Success: the spell succeeds as cast.
  - Mixed Success: the spell succeeds, but there are side effects. (Use wild magic tables or something to that effect)
  - Failure: the spell fails, AND there are side effects.
  - Regardless, the Mana and actions are spent.
