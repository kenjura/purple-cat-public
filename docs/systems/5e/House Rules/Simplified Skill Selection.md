# Simplified Skill Selection

As an alternative to the skills granted by your class and background, you can instead just choose any 4 skills.

You still retain any skills or proficiencies that are automatically granted by your class (such as Thieves' Tools for a rogue).

You are not obligated to use this option, but if you do, your class and background (if any) do not grant any skill selection. Has no bearing on racial features.
