# Counterspelling

Any spellcaster can counter a spell or spell-like ability by matching initiative, spending the same action and mana (or spell slots), and using a spell that either roughly duplicates the effect or duplicates an effect that would negate it.

If all of the above conditions are met, roll opposed spellcasting skill checks; if the counterspeller's result is higher, they negate the spell. Either way, their spell has no effect other than to counter or attempt to counter.

*If the spell you are counterspelling costs more than twice the Mana of the one you're using to counter, you have disadvantage to the roll. You can add Mana to avoid this.*


# Dispelling

As Counterspelling, but against a spell already in progress.


# Metamagic (beta)

All Mana-using spellcasters can modify the parameters of their spells when casting them, unless otherwise noted.

Each effect costs as much Mana as the base spell. (If the DM has the stomach for it, you can pro-rate for lesser effects)

Metamagic | Effect per 1 Mana
--------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
Widen     | Double the area (burst 2->4, cone 5->10, etc, only works on AoEs)
Enlarge   | Increase range by 100% (or turn Long Range into Ranged if using [Simplified Range](<./Simplified Range.md>))
Extend    | Increase duration by 100% (not valid for concentration)


Questions considered:
+ Should silent, still, etc be a factor of spending Mana, or something else?
  + Forget 'em. These barely *ever* come into play. If the situation arises, let them have their moment in the sun.
+ Sustain: +100% mana to turn Concentration into self-sustaining? Or is this something else?
  + Concentration is an important mechanic that should not be easily modified. No changes.
+ What about empowerment?
  + Damage per round is carefully balanced; we don't need "combo points" at this stage.
