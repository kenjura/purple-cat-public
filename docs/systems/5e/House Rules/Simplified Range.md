# Simplified Range

Instead of getting hyper specific with the range of weapons and spells...

+ The range called "ranged" means "within reasonable range".
+ If the DM thinks an attack seems particularly long range, but doable, that's considered "long range", and the attack is at a disadvantage (or, if no attack roll is needed, defenders save at advantage)
+ If the DM thinks the attack is just plain impossible to land, it is out of range.

I hesitate to add specific numbers as guidelines, but if necessary:
+ "Ranged" means a typical melee fighter could perhaps reach the target, if a path existed, and he dedicated his turn to doing so
+ "Long range" means the same fighter couldn't do so in one round, but perhaps in a couple or a few rounds
+ "Out of range" means that fighter couldn't conceivably do so within a reasonable encounter time
