# Mana

Mana is an alternative to Spell Slots.

Getting it:
+ Your class grants a base amount of Mana per level. Examples:
  + 2 Mana/level: [/5e/Classes/Elementalist](Elementalist), [/5e/Classes/Invoker](Invoker), [/5e/Classes/Witch](Witch)
+ Every class has a maximum amount of Mana that can be spent per casting action.
  + For the [/5e/Classes/Elementalist](Elementalist), [/5e/Classes/Invoker](Invoker), and [/5e/Classes/Witch](Witch), this is equal to 1 Mana for each odd level achieved, e.g. 1 at level 1-2, 2 at level 3-4, etc.

Spending it:
+ Instead of spell slots, you expend 1 Mana per spell level when casting a spell.

Notes:
+ Mana generally leaves you with fewer overall spells per day, especially at higher levels, but much more flexibility in what you cast and when.
