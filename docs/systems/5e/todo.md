# Invoker Spell Overhaul

- Fey
  - Color
    - Removed Color Pool -- it's redundant as a defensive spell (same benefit as chromatic shield, and there's already a more iconic area defense spell in Color Veil) and its utility as a buff for sprites is gone
    - Rainbow Beam lowered to rank 2, now single target (can still be widened into a line)
  - Glamour
  	- Removed Attraction; it's just a use case of Emotion
  	- Removed Obsession; see above
  - Wonders
    - Ideation / Animate Objects: now a single spell that creates "figments" but they're real. OP? We'll see.
    - Daydream: redundant with Emotion
    - Spellmorph: changed to "replaces a spell with a different effect or a wild surge, depending on your skill check" and increased to rank 3
  - Summons
    - Total overhaul
- Most swift spells should be converted to single action with appropriate power rebalance
  - Remaining swift spells clarified as bonus
- Add reactions
- Split Sprite from Color
- Add Torment and Chains/Punishment to Infernal
  - Torment = pain
  - Chains or Punishment = imprisonment, penance
- Shadow schools:
  - Madness
  - Dissolution
  - Entropy
  - Soul
