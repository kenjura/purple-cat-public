# Aeon Korr

Born and raised on [Chandaar](), capital of the now-defunct [Star Kingdom of Tion](), son of noble lord and wealthy businessman [Titus Korr](), Aeon was destined for privilege from birth. Rejecting his father's career path, he sought honor in the [Royal Marines](), achieving the rank of Captain (O-3) while serving in the [Clone Wars](), before a terrible injury--survived only by the integration of many cybernetic parts--prompted his removal from active duty, and his transfer to the [Kingsguard](), a prestigous assignment lacking in much real danger.

During the [Battle of Chandaar](), the mad king [Robeir Arcturian]() refused to surrender, forcing the planet's defenses to endure a tireless siege by the [Grand Army of the Republic]() despite hopeless odds. Aeon took it upon himself to slay his charge and liege, signaling to the planetary defenses using the King's authority to stand down. By the time the ruse was discovered, it was far too late to resume hostilities.

Although many argue that his actions saved potentially billions of lives, Aeon did break many laws by doing so. A military tribunal found him guilty of insubordination and conduct unbecoming an officer, sentencing him to dishonorable discharge. The laws of the Star Kingdom prohibited a military or civilian court of commons from charging him with capital crimes (including murder and treason), but the lack of any sovereign complicated matters. Later, a court under Viceroy [TBD]() convened to determine his guilt; the matter, having long been dealt with behind closed doors, was settled, with Aeon found guilty of "aggravated manslaughter" and "deriliction of duty", but neither of murder nor treason. His sentence was commuted for a combination of "time served" (very little) and "extenuating circumstances", and was left a free man--if much maligned in certain sectors.

Since his disgrace, Aeon has further rejected offers to join the private sector under his father, choosing instead to live a playboy's lifestyle, funded by his "work" as a professional duelist--a legal but questionable occupation that has allowed him to pay his bills.
