+ ^1^: When speaking the name of a noble of the house, one uses the Genitive form. For example: Zelena Andromedae is of the House Andromedes
+ ^2^: The original twelve houses cohabitated on Tion, but during the rise of the Tion Hegemony each claimed a Throneworld. Since they have kept these worlds for the majority of Tion's history, it is prudent to list them here.
+ ^3^: House Vela's symbology is a reference to the ''Argo Navis'', the original colony ship that bore the Survivors to Tion.
+ ^4^: Usually portrayed as a marlin or swordfish, because, come on.
+ ^5^: The House of Arcturus succeeded the house of Koronos, and they reigned long until their last monarch, Robeir Arcturian, was slain by the Kingslayer [Aeon Korr](). According to official propaganda of the Cronese Mandate, the House of Koronos has re-succeeded the House of Arcturus, despite having no current members.

Note:

* [Cadinth]() probably deserves to be a throneworld. It was one of the Four Thrones of Cron, after all.
