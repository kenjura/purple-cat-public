_A long time in the future, in this very galaxy..._

## Throne of Stars

> Seven thousand years ago, humankind had blossomed into a galactic civilization, fully developing their home star system and expanding into those nearby. That journey nearly came to an end when an unknown alien threat known as the GREAT ADVERSARY virtually annihilated human civilization, reducing the population to a tiny fraction, a few scattered survivors.

> From that humble beginning, with kind aid from a friendlier alien race known as the IL'UM, humanity spread into the stars colonizing thousands of worlds. On one of those worlds, TION PRIME, a queen forged a Star Empire which would go on to conquer nearly all of human space. For nearly four millennia, the PAX ANDROMEDAE nurtured the growth of humanity from a scattered few to well over a trillion today, dwarfing even the population of Earth That Was.

> The peace ended when the last Queen of House Andromedes was assassinated by her own Royal Guard. What followed were centuries of war, eventually giving way to a fragile peace, supported by an oligarchy of TWELVE HOUSES, families owning vast swathes of resources, corporations, and private armies. Civilization endures, although much of the progress of Earth That Was and the Pax Andromedae has been lost to the greed of the oligarchic "nobles".

> Little do they know that the last scion of Andromedes lives on, secluded on an impossible world within the mass shadow of a black hole in the heart of another galaxy. ZELENA ANDROMEDAE was raised from birth to restore the rightful order of the galaxy, and to take her place as Queen. With the aid of her Royal Guard AEON KORR and the fearsome bounty hunter PHOBOS, she aims to do just that.

> The road ahead is long. The Twelve Houses will not go quietly. The secrets and lies of old will not endure the coming truth. But a new dawn is coming for humankind, when Zelena claims the THRONE OF STARS.
